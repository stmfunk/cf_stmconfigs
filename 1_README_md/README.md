# CFTrack (config tracker)
CFTrack is version control for your entire system. Add configuration files from
around your system and store them in a central location. The goal is to allow you
rollback changes and track them by date. Currently it is a tool that automatically
creates nested git repositories for tracked files and allows you to update them
all with a single command.
